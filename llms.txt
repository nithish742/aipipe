# ipify

ipify is a simple, reliable public IP address API that allows clients to determine their external IPv4 or IPv6 address. It is widely used because of its high availability, open-source stewardship, and privacy-focused policies: ipify does **not log visitor IP addresses**. Its lightweight design and global endpoints make it dependable for applications, scripts, or automated systems needing quick IP resolution.
